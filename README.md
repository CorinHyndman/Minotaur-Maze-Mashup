# Minotaur-Maze-Mashup
Minotaur-Maze-Mashup was my end of year project for AS-Level with the task of making a game. It is a combination of tetris and bomberman and borrows many ideas from both being implemented in Winforms with C#.

# How to play
The game is broken into 2 "stages" the first being classic tetris with the [â†‘] arrow rotating the piece try fill all squares in a row to clear it and gain points.
Each tetris piece is either "Invisible" (Blue) or "Wall" (Grey). Once the player reaches the top of the screen all the "Wall" pieces transform into the walls for the seconds stage and the "Invisible" walls disappear.
The second stage the player is being chased by a minotaur and must collect all scrolls to unlock the exit and win. Standard arrow movement controls and the [Space] key to place a bomb that blows up adjacent walls.
The minotaur can shift the walls around to try trap the player so strategically placing bombs is a must. The player has 3 lives and gets invincibility frames and a speed boost upon contact with the minotaur.
A sword becomes available once the exit is unlocked for added reward if the player stays to kill the minotaur.
